# Contact-List-React

This is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to manage a list of contacts. Users can add new contacts, view existing contacts, update contact information, and delete contacts.

## Features

- View contacts: All existing contacts are displayed in a list format, showing their name, email, and phone number.

- Delete contacts: Users can delete contacts by clicking on the delete button next to each contact.
- Top placement of new contacts: When adding a new contact, it is placed at the top of the contact list for easy visibility.
